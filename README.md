# SWE-Quiz_Solution
Spent a month practicing for my technical interview. Solve a few puzzles in Python and a few more in R. Hopefully this would be helpful someday to someone or myself!
Most of these questions gathered from lintcode, leetcode, interview cake etc are for SWE positions, but since I am applying for non-SWE position, I mostly ignore data structure and complexity issues and focus more on algorithmic thinking.
